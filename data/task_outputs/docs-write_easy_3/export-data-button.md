- Located near the top-right of your current view

## Supported Export Formats

Metabase lets you export data as:

- CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- XLSX (Excel spreadsheet)
- JSON

## How to Export

1. Run a query or navigate to a dashboard
2. Look for the **Export Data** button (usually represented by a download icon)
