# Exporting Data from Metabase

## Finding the Export Data Button

You can export data from most query results and dashboard visualizations using the **Export Data** button. Look for this button in the top-right corner of your query results or dashboard card.

## Export Options

When you click the **Export Data** button, you'll typically see several export formats:

- CSV
- JSON
- XLSX (Excel)

## Where to Find Your Exported Files

- **Desktop**: Files will download to your computer's default download folder
- **Web Browser**: Check your browser's download history or download folder
- **Mobile**: Exported files will be saved to your device's standard download location

### Tips

- Large datasets might take a moment to export
- Some very large exports may be limited by your database or Metabase configuration
- Exported files maintain the current view of your data, including any applied filters

## Permissions

Not seeing the export option? Check with your Metabase administrator about export permissions.
