  "response": "I'll help you improve your skill description by making it more specific and following the best practices from the Skill Development guide. Let me walk you through how to create a more effective description.\n\nA good skill description should:\n1. Use third-person perspective\n2. Include specific trigger phrases\n3. Clearly state what the skill does\n4. Be concrete about use cases\n\nHere's a template to help you improve your description:\n\n```yaml\ndescription: This skill should be used when the user wants to [specific actions], such as \"action example 1\", \"action example 2\", or \"action example 3\". Provides guidance for [specific type of file handling] with focus on [key capabilities].\n```\n\nLet me give you some concrete examples to illustrate:\n\n1. For a generic file handling skill:\n```yaml\ndescription: This skill should be used when the user asks to \"rename multiple files\", \"organize files by type\", \"search through file contents\", \"convert file formats\", or manage file operations across different directories.\n```\n\n2. For a more specific file skill:\n```yaml\ndescription: This skill should be used when the user wants to \"process CSV files\", \"clean data in spreadsheets\", \"extract information from PDFs\", \"validate file formats\", or perform advanced file parsing and transformation tasks.\n```\n\n3. For a developer-focused file skill:\n```yaml\ndescription: This skill should be used when the user needs to \"manipulate source code files\", \"refactor directory structures\", \"batch process code repositories\", \"extract code snippets\", or perform complex file-based development tasks.\n```\n\nTo help you craft the perfect description, I recommend answering these questions:\n1. What specific types of files does your skill work with?\n2. What key actions can users perform with this skill?\n3. What makes this skill unique or powerful?\n\nWould you like to share more details about your skill so I can help you create a more precise description?",
