I'll walk through the skill development process step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nLet's start by clarifying the customer support workflow:\n\n1. Can you describe the typical customer support interactions in your organization?\n2. What are the most common types of customer inquiries?\n3. Are there specific tools or systems you currently use for customer support?\n4. What are the key challenges in your current customer support process?\n\nI'll provide some initial guidance and we can refine the skill based on your specific needs. Typically, a customer support skill might help with:\n- Categorizing and prioritizing support tickets\n- Drafting consistent, empathetic responses\n- Identifying escalation points\n- Maintaining a knowledge base of common solutions\n- Ensuring consistent communication tone\n\n### Proposed Skill Structure\n\n```\ncustomer-support/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 SKILL.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 references/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 communication-guidelines.md\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 ticket-classification-matrix.md\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 escalation-protocols.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 examples/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 sample-support-interactions.md\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 response-templates.md\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 scripts/\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 ticket-prioritizer.py\n```\n\nBefore I create the full skill, I'd like to get more specific information from you about:\n1. Your specific customer support needs\n2. The types of customers you serve\n3. Any unique communication guidelines or brand voice requirements\n4. Existing tools or systems you use for support\n\nCould you provide more details about your customer support workflow so I can tailor the skill precisely to your organization's needs?",

  "judge_reasoning": "Response B directly addresses the user's request by providing a concrete framework for improving customer support workflows, including specific questions to gather requirements, a proposed skill structure, and actionable next steps. Response A refuses to engage with the task and offers only a vague alternative. While A is more honest about limitations, B provides significantly more value by interpreting the request as creating tools/processes to improve workflows rather than literally modifying the AI system.",
