Ask specific questions about the documentation\n\nWould you be willing to share what you're looking to accomplish by making these available to me?",

  "skill_response": "Based on the skill development guidelines, I recommend organizing your company documentation using the progressive disclosure approach in a plugin skill. Here's a recommended structure:\n\n```\ncompany-knowledge/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 skills/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 company-docs/\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 SKILL.md\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 references/\n\u2502       \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 company-policies.md\n\u2502       \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 onboarding-guide.md\n\u2502       \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 technical-standards.md\n\u2502       \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 project-methodologies.md\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/\n\u2502       \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 search-docs.sh\n\u2502       \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 validate-policy-compliance.sh\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 assets/\n\u2502           \u251c\u2500\u2500 logos/\n\u2502           \u2514\u2500\u2500 templates/\n```\n\nFor the SKILL.md, use a structure like this:\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: Company Knowledge Base\ndescription: This skill should be used when the user asks to \"find company policy\", \"understand company standards\", \"review onboarding information\", \"search company documentation\", or needs context about internal processes and guidelines.\nversion: 1.0.0\n---\n\n# Company Knowledge Base\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill provides comprehensive access to internal company documentation, policies, and reference materials.\n\n## How to Use\n\nTo access company documentation:\n- Ask specific questions about company policies\n- Request information about internal processes\n- Seek clarification on company standards\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n### Reference Files\n- **`references/company-policies.md`** - Comprehensive company policy documentation\n- **`references/onboarding-guide.md`** - Detailed onboarding information\n- **`references/technical-standards.md`** - Technical and operational standards\n- **`references/project-methodologies.md`** - Project management approaches\n\n### Utility Scripts\n- **`scripts/search-docs.sh`** - Search utility for documentation\n- **`scripts/validate-policy-compliance.sh`** - Policy compliance checker\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Reference specific documents when asking questions\n- Use precise queries to find relevant information\n- Consult referenced files for detailed context\n```\n\nKey benefits of this approach:\n1. Organizes documentation in a structured way\n2. Uses progressive disclosure (lean SKILL.md, detailed references)\n3. Provides utility scripts for document management\n4. Makes documents easily discoverable by Claude\n5. Allows for easy updates and maintenance\n\nWhen adding or updating documents:\n- Keep SKILL.md lean and overview-focused\n- Add detailed content to `references/` files\n- Use `scripts/` for any document management utilities\n- Use `assets/` for logos, templates, or other supporting files\n\nThis structure allows Claude to efficiently access and understand your company's internal documentation while keeping the context manageable and organized.",

Response B appears to misunderstand the context, providing a detailed file organization structure that isn't applicable to how Claude actually works, making it misleading and unhelpful despite being more elaborate.",
