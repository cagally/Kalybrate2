  "prompt": "My React development assistant uses claude-sonnet-4-20250514 and keeps saying 'I think we should...' in responses, but after upgrading to Opus 4.5 it's acting weird with that phrasing. Also, the frontend designs it creates look really generic now. I need help with the full migration and fixing these issues.",

  "response": "I'll help you migrate your React development assistant to Opus 4.5 and address the specific issues you're experiencing. I'll break this down into steps:\n\n1. Model String Update\nFirst, I'll update the model string. Assuming you're using the Anthropic API, I'll replace the Sonnet 4.0 model string:\n\n```python\n# Before\nmodel = \"claude-sonnet-4-20250514\"\n\n# After\nmodel = \"claude-opus-4-5-20251101\"\n```\n\n2. Thinking Sensitivity Mitigation\nTo address the \"I think\" phrasing issue, I'll create a system prompt modification:\n\n```python\nsystem_prompt = \"\"\"\n<communication_guidelines>\n- Avoid using \"I think\" or similar tentative phrasings\n- Provide direct, confident recommendations\n- Use clear, assertive language when suggesting solutions\n- Replace \"I think we should...\" with more definitive statements like \"We should...\" or \"The recommended approach is...\"\n</communication_guidelines>\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n3. Frontend Design Improvement\nI'll add a specific snippet to enhance frontend design quality:\n\n```python\nfrontend_design_guidelines = \"\"\"\n<frontend_design_guidelines>\n- Prioritize modern, clean, and minimalist design principles\n- Use contemporary color palettes with high contrast and readability\n- Implement responsive design that works seamlessly across devices\n- Pay attention to micro-interactions and subtle animations\n- Ensure consistent typography and spacing\n- Use design systems like Material Design or Tailwind for professional, cohesive looks\n- Avoid generic, template-like designs by adding unique, purposeful design elements\n</frontend_design_guidelines>\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n4. Over-Engineering Prevention\nTo prevent unnecessary complexity:\n\n```python\ncode_complexity_guidelines = \"\"\"\n<code_complexity_guidelines>\n- Solve the specific problem directly\n- Avoid premature abstraction or over-engineering\n- Create minimal, focused solutions\n- Only add complexity when there's a clear, demonstrated need\n- Prefer simple, readable code over unnecessarily flexible architectures\n</code_complexity_guidelines>\n\"\"\"\n```\n\nHere's a Python script that could help integrate these changes:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef update_react_assistant_config():\n    # Create a migrations directory if it doesn't exist\n    os.makedirs('migrations', exist_ok=True)\n    \n    # Write migration notes\n    with open('migrations/opus_4_5_migration_notes.txt', 'w') as f:\n        f.write(\"\"\"Opus 4.5 Migration Notes\n1. Updated model from Sonnet 4.0 to Opus 4.5\n2. Modified communication style to be more direct\n3. Enhanced frontend design guidelines\n4. Added over-engineering prevention instructions\n\"\"\")\n    \n    # Optionally, you could write the new prompt guidelines to a file\n    with open('migrations/system_prompt_updates.txt', 'w') as f:\n        f.write(system_prompt + \"\\n\\n\" + frontend_design_guidelines + \"\\n\\n\" + code_complexity_guidelines)\n\n    print(\"Migration files created successfully!\")\n\n# Run the migration\nupdate_react_assistant_config()\n```\n\nRecommendations for Implementation:\n1. Integrate the new system prompt guidelines into your existing system prompt\n2. Modify your API call to use the new Opus 4.5 model string\n3. Run tests to ensure the assistant's behavior meets your expectations\n\nFinal Notes:\n- These changes address the specific issues you mentioned\n- The new guidelines should make the assistant more direct and design-conscious\n- If you encounter any further issues, we can fine-tune the approach\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these changes or help you integrate them into your specific React development assistant?",
