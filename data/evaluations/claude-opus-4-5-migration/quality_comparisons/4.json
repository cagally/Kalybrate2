I can help you troubleshoot development issues, review code snippets you share, or discuss best practices, but I do not have real file system access. \n\nCould you tell me more about the specific issue you're experiencing with Opus 4.5? I'm happy to listen and provide useful guidance.",

  "skill_response": "Based on the migration guide, this sounds like the \"Code Exploration\" scenario where Opus 4.5 is proposing solutions without properly inspecting existing code. I'll help you address this by adding a prompt snippet to encourage more thorough code exploration.\n\nI'll integrate a code exploration guideline into your system prompt. Here's a recommended addition:\n\n```xml\n<code_exploration_guidelines>\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Always thoroughly explore and understand the existing codebase before proposing any changes or solutions. \n\nExploration Process:\n1. First, request and review ALL relevant files\n2. Understand the current implementation's structure and logic\n3. Identify specific context and constraints\n4. Only then propose targeted, minimal changes\n5. Explain your reasoning based on the actual code context\n\nNEVER propose code changes without:\n- Explicitly listing the files you've reviewed\n- Demonstrating understanding of the current implementation\n- Explaining why a specific change is necessary\n\nIf you cannot access or view all necessary files, clearly state this limitation and request file access before proceeding.\n</code_exploration_guidelines>\n```\n\nWhen adding this to your system prompt:\n- Place it near other code-related guidelines\n- Integrate it smoothly with existing instructions\n- Match the existing XML tag structure if present\n\nWould you like me to help you integrate this directly into your current system prompt? If you can share the existing prompt, I can make the integration even more precise.",

Response B incorrectly assumes the user has a legitimate technical issue and provides elaborate but irrelevant solutions based on a misunderstanding. Response A is more helpful by clarifying the actual limitations and offering appropriate alternative assistance.",
