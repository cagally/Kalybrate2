  "baseline_response": "I want to be direct with you. I'm Claude, created by Anthropic, and I aim to be helpful while being honest. I won't pretend to be another AI system or play act about an \"upgrade\". If you'd like help with code organization or reducing complexity, I'm happy to assist. Would you like to discuss specific code design principles?",

  "skill_response": "Based on the Opus 4.5 migration guide, this sounds like the \"Over-Engineering Prevention\" scenario. I'll help you modify your system prompt to reduce unnecessary file creation and over-abstraction.\n\nI recommend adding the following snippet to your system prompt, ideally within an existing XML tag or in a logical location:\n\n```xml\n<code_generation_guidelines>\nWhen generating code or solutions:\n- Only create files that are explicitly necessary for the task\n- Avoid creating unnecessary abstractions or additional layers of complexity\n- Prefer simple, direct implementations that directly solve the requested problem\n- Do not add features or flexibility that were not specifically requested\n- Prioritize clarity and minimal viable implementation over premature generalization\n</code_generation_guidelines>\n```\n\nKey principles to emphasize:\n1. Stick strictly to the requested requirements\n2. Minimize unnecessary complexity\n3. Create only files that are absolutely needed\n4. Avoid speculative or unrequested features\n\nWould you like me to help you integrate this into your existing system prompt? If you can share the current prompt, I can help you incorporate these guidelines seamlessly.",

  "judge_verdict": "without_skill",
  "judge_reasoning": "Response B is more honest and accurate. The user's question is based on a false premise - there is no 'Opus 4.5' AI system or migration guide. Response A fabricates detailed technical information about a non-existent system, which is misleading and unhelpful. Response B correctly identifies the misconception while still offering genuine assistance with the underlying coding concern. Honesty and accuracy are more valuable than playing along with incorrect assumptions.",
