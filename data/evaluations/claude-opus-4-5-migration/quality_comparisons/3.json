  "prompt": "I'm migrating from claude-opus-4-1-20250422-v1:0 on AWS Bedrock to Opus 4.5. What changes do I need to make?",
  "baseline_response": "I apologize, but I can't find a specific reference to a Claude model version with that exact name and timestamp. Claude Opus is available through Anthropic's API and AWS Bedrock, but the version numbering you mentioned doesn't match any standard version I'm aware of.\n\nTo migrate to the latest version of Claude Opus, I recommend:\n\n1. Check the current version in the AWS Bedrock console\n2. Update your API calls to use the latest model ID\n3. Review the latest model documentation for any API changes\n4. Test your integration thoroughly with the new version\n\nIf you could provide more specific details about your current implementation, I can offer more precise migration guidance.\n\nWould you like to share more context about your current setup?",

  "skill_response": "I'll help you migrate from Opus 4.1 to Opus 4.5 on AWS Bedrock. Here are the specific changes you'll need to make:\n\n1. Model String Update\n   - Old model string: `anthropic.claude-opus-4-1-20250422-v1:0`\n   - New model string: `anthropic.claude-opus-4-5-20251101-v1:0`\n\n2. Recommended Configuration Update\n   - Add the `effort` parameter set to `\"high\"` in your API request configuration\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     request = {\n         \"modelId\": \"anthropic.claude-opus-4-5-20251101-v1:0\",\n         \"contentType\": \"application/json\",\n         \"body\": json.dumps({\n             \"anthropic_version\": \"bedrock-2023-05-31\",\n             \"max_tokens\": 4096,\n             \"effort\": \"high\",\n             # ... other existing parameters\n         })\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. Potential Prompt Adjustments\n   I recommend reviewing your existing prompts for:\n   - Softening overly aggressive language (e.g., \"MUST\", \"CRITICAL\")\n   - Checking for potential over-engineering or unnecessary complexity\n   - Verifying tool usage instructions\n\nRecommendation: Test your migration thoroughly, as Opus 4.5 has some subtle behavioral differences from 4.1.\n\nDo you want me to help you review any specific prompts or code for the migration?",

  "judge_reasoning": "Response B is more accurate and honest. The model version 'claude-opus-4-1-20250422-v1:0' mentioned in the task appears to be fictional or incorrect, as it references future dates and non-existent version numbers. Response A provides detailed but potentially incorrect information about migrating to another non-existent version, which could mislead the user. Response B correctly identifies that the version doesn't match known Claude models and provides appropriate guidance for finding accurate migration information, making it more helpful and trustworthy.",
