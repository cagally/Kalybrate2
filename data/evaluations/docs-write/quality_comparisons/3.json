Whether you need a quick CSV or a scheduled report, we've got you covered.\n\n## Export Formats\n\nMetabase supports multiple export formats to fit different workflows:\n\n### CSV (Comma-Separated Values)\n- **Best for:** Spreadsheets, data analysis\n- **What you get:** A plain text file with data in columns\n- **How to export:** \n  1. Open the question or result you want to export\n  2. Click the **Download** button\n  3. Select **CSV**\n\n### Excel (.xlsx)\n- **Best for:** Microsoft Excel, complex spreadsheet work\n- **What you get:** A full-featured spreadsheet file\n- **How to export:**\n  1. Open the question or result\n  2. Click the **Download** button\n  3. Select **Excel**\n\n### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)\n- **Best for:** Developers, API integrations\n- **What you get:** A structured data format for programming\n- **How to export:**\n  1. Open the question or result\n  2. Click the **Download** button\n  3. Select **JSON**\n\n## Scheduling Exports\n\n### Automatic Recurring Exports\n\nYou can set up scheduled exports for dashboards and questions:\n\n1. Open the dashboard or question\n2. Click **Subscribe**\n3. Choose:\n   - Frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)\n   - Time of export\n   - Delivery method (email, Slack)\n\n#### Export Options\n- **File Format:** Choose CSV, Excel, or PDF\n- **Recipients:** Add team members who should receive the export\n- **Filters:** Apply current dashboard or question filters to each export\n\n## Handling Large Datasets\n\n### Export Strategies\n\n**Small Datasets:** Export directly from the interface\n\n**Large Datasets:** \n- Use **Pagination** or **Sampling** to manage export size\n- For very large datasets, consider:\n  1. Break into smaller queries\n  2. Use database-level export tools\n  3. Consult with your database admin\n\n### Performance Tips\n- **Filter first:** Narrow down your data before exporting\n- **Sample data:** Use sampling for quick insights\n- **Check export size** before sending large files\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Export Issues\n- **Timeout:** Happens with very large datasets\n  - Solution: Add more filters, reduce data scope\n- **Missing Data:** Verify your current view and filters\n- **Format Problems:** Ensure destination app supports the file type\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- Exported data inherits your current permissions\n- Only export data you're authorized to see\n- Be cautious with sensitive information\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Export Need | Recommended Format |\n|------------|-------------------|\n| Spreadsheet Work | Excel (.xlsx) |\n| Data Analysis | CSV |\n| Developer Integrations | JSON |\n| Presentation | PDF |\n\n## Related Documentation\n- [Sharing Dashboards](/docs/sharing/dashboards)\n- [Permissions Overview](/docs/permissions/overview)",

  "judge_reasoning": "Response A provides a more comprehensive and complete user guide that covers all requested topics thoroughly. It includes detailed sections on export formats with clear explanations, comprehensive scheduling options with multiple destinations, and begins addressing large dataset management. Response B appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence) and seems to be written specifically for Metabase rather than as a general user guide as requested. Response A also has better organization with clear hierarchical structure and more actionable instructions.",
