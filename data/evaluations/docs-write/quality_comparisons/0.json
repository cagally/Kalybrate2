  "judge_verdict": "without_skill",
  "judge_reasoning": "Response A is more complete and thorough, covering all three required areas (account setup, creating first dashboard, adding basic charts) with detailed steps. It also includes valuable additional sections like customization, sharing, and tips for success. Response B appears incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence) and assumes a specific platform (Metabase) rather than being generic, making it less useful as a template guide.",
