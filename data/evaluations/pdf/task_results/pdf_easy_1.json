  "response": "I'll help you extract text from a PDF using Python. Here's a complete script that will extract text from a PDF:\n\n```python\nfrom pypdf import PdfReader\n\ndef extract_pdf_text(pdf_path):\n    # Open the PDF file\n    try:\n        reader = PdfReader(pdf_path)\n        \n        # Initialize an empty string to store the text\n        full_text = \"\"\n        \n        # Extract text from each page\n        for page in reader.pages:\n            # Add the text from the current page to our full text\n            full_text += page.extract_text() + \"\\n\\n\"\n        \n        return full_text.strip()\n    \n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        return f\"Error: The file {pdf_path} was not found.\"\n    except Exception as e:\n        return f\"An error occurred: {str(e)}\"\n\n# Example usage\npdf_path = \"report.pdf\"  # Replace with your PDF file path\nextracted_text = extract_pdf_text(pdf_path)\n\n# Print the extracted text (which you can then copy into an email)\nprint(extracted_text)\n```\n\nTo use this script:\n\n1. Install the required library first:\n```bash\npip install pypdf\n```\n\n2. Replace `\"report.pdf\"` with the path to your actual PDF file.\n\n3. Run the script. It will print out all the text from the PDF.\n\nA few additional tips:\n- This works best with PDFs that have selectable text\n- For scanned PDFs or image-based PDFs, you'll need OCR (optical character recognition)\n- The script adds two newlines between pages to help separate page content\n\nIf you want to save the text to a file instead of just printing:\n```python\n# Add this after extracting the text\nwith open(\"extracted_text.txt\", \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as text_file:\n    text_file.write(extracted_text)\n```\n\nWould you like me to help you further with extracting text from your specific PDF?",
