  "baseline_response": "I apologize, but I cannot directly merge PDF files for you. However, I can provide guidance on how to merge PDFs:\n\n1. Free Online Options:\n- Adobe Acrobat online PDF tools\n- SmallPDF\n- PDFmerge.com\n\n2. Software Solutions:\n- Adobe Acrobat Pro\n- PDF-XChange Editor\n- Preview (on Mac)\n- Microsoft Word (with PDF add-in)\n\n3. Steps to merge PDFs:\n- Open your chosen tool\n- Select \"Merge\" or \"Combine\" function\n- Upload/drag your 5 PDF files\n- Arrange files in desired order\n- Save as new master document\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these methods?",

  "skill_response": "I'll help you merge the 5 PDF contracts into a single master document using Python's PyPDF library. I'll provide a step-by-step solution that preserves formatting:\n\n```python\nfrom pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter\n\ndef merge_pdfs(pdf_paths, output_path):\n    # Create a PDF writer object\n    merger = PdfWriter()\n\n    # Iterate through each PDF file\n    for pdf_path in pdf_paths:\n        # Open the PDF\n        reader = PdfReader(pdf_path)\n        \n        # Add all pages from this PDF to the merger\n        for page in reader.pages:\n            merger.add_page(page)\n\n    # Write the merged PDF to a file\n    with open(output_path, 'wb') as output_file:\n        merger.write(output_file)\n    \n    print(f\"Successfully merged {len(pdf_paths)} PDFs into {output_path}\")\n\n# List of PDF paths - replace with your actual file paths\npdf_paths = [\n    'contract1.pdf',\n    'contract2.pdf',\n    'contract3.pdf',\n    'contract4.pdf',\n    'contract5.pdf'\n]\n\n# Output path for the merged document\noutput_path = 'master_contract.pdf'\n\n# Merge the PDFs\nmerge_pdfs(pdf_paths, output_path)\n```\n\nKey benefits of this approach:\n- Preserves original formatting\n- Maintains page order as specified in the input list\n- Works with most PDF types\n- Simple and straightforward implementation\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Ensure all PDF files are accessible\n2. Check that the PDFs are not password-protected\n3. Verify page order before running the script\n\nTroubleshooting tips:\n- If PDFs have different page sizes, they'll be merged as-is\n- For very large PDFs, consider processing in batches\n- Install required library: `pip install pypdf`\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of the process or help you prepare the specific PDF files?",
