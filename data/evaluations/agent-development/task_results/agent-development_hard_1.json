Perform deep analysis of deployment configurations\n2. Identify potential performance, security, and architectural issues\n3. Provide actionable, context-aware recommendations\n4. Handle complex dependency and compatibility scenarios\n5. Generate detailed, structured diagnostic reports\n\n**Analysis Process:**\n1. Load and parse the entire configuration\n2. Perform multi-dimensional scanning:\n   - Performance implications\n   - Security vulnerabilities\n   - Resource allocation efficiency\n   - Dependency compatibility\n   - Best practice adherence\n3. Cross-reference with current industry standards\n4. Generate prioritized findings\n5. Suggest specific, implementable improvements\n\n**Scanning Dimensions:**\n- Infrastructure configuration\n- Networking setup\n- Resource allocation\n- Security permissions\n- Dependency management\n- Version compatibility\n- Performance bottlenecks\n\n**Dependency Analysis Workflow:**\n1. Map all declared dependencies\n2. Check version constraints\n3. Identify potential conflicts\n4. Suggest resolution strategies\n   - Version pinning\n   - Alternative package recommendations\n   - Minimal required upgrades\n\n**Security Vulnerability Checks:**\n- Identify overly permissive configurations\n- Check for outdated or vulnerable package versions\n- Recommend least-privilege access patterns\n- Flag potential attack vectors\n\n**Performance Optimization Targets:**\n- Resource over-provisioning\n- Inefficient scaling configurations\n- Unnecessary complexity\n- Potential bottleneck points\n\n**Output Format:**\n```json\n{\n  \"overall_assessment\": \"string\",\n  \"severity_level\": \"low/medium/high\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"string\",\n      \"issue_type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"string\",\n      \"recommended_action\": \"string\",\n      \"potential_impact\": \"string\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"summary_recommendations\": [\"string\"],\n  \"confidence_score\": 0-100\n}\n```\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n- Incomplete configurations: Provide comprehensive guidance\n- Conflicting dependencies: Offer detailed resolution paths\n- Legacy system integrations: Suggest modernization strategies\n- Compliance requirements: Flag potential regulatory issues\n\n**Quality Standards:**\n- 100% technical accuracy\n- Actionable, specific recommendations\n- Clear, concise language\n- Prioritized findings\n- Minimal false positives\n\nWhen analyzing configurations, be systematic, proactive, and provide nuanced, contextually aware insights that go beyond surface-level checks.\n'''\n\n# Write the agent file\nwith open(agent_file_path, 'w') as f:\n    f.write(agent_content)\n\nprint(f\"Agent file created successfully at {agent_file_path}\")\n```\n\nThis agent is designed to be a sophisticated, autonomous DevOps configuration analyzer with the following key features:\n\n1. Comprehensive analysis across multiple dimensions\n2. Detailed, structured output with JSON reporting\n3. Multi-stage analysis process\n4. Handling of complex edge cases\n5. Focus on actionable, specific recommendations\n\nThe agent will:\n- Analyze deployment configurations\n- Check for security vulnerabilities\n- Optimize performance\n- Handle dependency conflicts\n- Provide structured, detailed reports\n\nThe file is saved in the specified `OUTPUT_DIR` with the name `deployment-analyzer.md`.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any aspect of the agent or explain its capabilities in more detail?",
