  "response": "Based on the agent development guidelines, here are some good potential names for a Python unit test generation agent:\n\n1. `python-test-generator`\n2. `unit-test-creator`\n3. `py-test-maker`\n4. `python-test-builder`\n\nI recommend `python-test-generator` as it's clear, descriptive, and follows the naming conventions:\n- Lowercase\n- Descriptive of function\n- Uses hyphens\n- Between 3-50 characters\n- Starts and ends with alphanumeric characters\n\nWould you like me to help you draft the full agent configuration for this Python unit test generation agent? I can create a comprehensive agent file with a detailed description, system prompt, and examples of when it should be triggered.",
