Let me break down the issues and provide a corrected version:\n\n### Identifier Validation Errors\n\nThe identifier `my_test_test_agent_v2.1` has multiple problems:\n1. Contains underscores (not allowed)\n2. Contains a period (not allowed)\n3. Complex version notation\n\n**Corrected Identifier:**\n- Use only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens\n- Remove underscores and period\n- Simplify version notation\n\nCorrected: `my-test-agent-v21`\n\n### Description Validation Errors\n\nThe description `helps with testing` is too generic and lacks:\n- Specific triggering conditions\n- Example use cases\n- Context for when the agent should be used\n\n**Corrected Description:**\n```markdown\nUse this agent when you need to validate testing scenarios or demonstrate agent configuration. \n\n<example>\nContext: Verifying agent configuration setup\nuser: \"Can you show me how this agent works?\"\nassistant: \"I'll demonstrate the agent's configuration and triggering mechanism.\"\n<commentary>\nThis agent is useful for illustrating agent development best practices and testing configuration validation.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Testing agent response capabilities\nuser: \"Provide an example of agent functionality\"\nassistant: \"Here's a sample demonstration of the agent's purpose and capabilities.\"\n<commentary>\nHelps showcase how agents can be configured with clear examples and purpose.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n```\n\n### Complete Corrected Agent Configuration\n\nHere's a full example of how the corrected agent might look:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: my-test-agent-v21\ndescription: Use this agent when you need to validate testing scenarios or demonstrate agent configuration. \n\n<example>\nContext: Verifying agent configuration setup\nuser: \"Can you show me how this agent works?\"\nassistant: \"I'll demonstrate the agent's configuration and triggering mechanism.\"\n<commentary>\nThis agent is useful for illustrating agent development best practices and testing configuration validation.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Testing agent response capabilities\nuser: \"Provide an example of agent functionality\"\nassistant: \"Here's a sample demonstration of the agent's purpose and capabilities.\"\n<commentary>\nHelps showcase how agents can be configured with clear examples and purpose.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\nmodel: inherit\ncolor: yellow\ntools: [\"Read\"]\n---\n\nYou are a test agent designed to demonstrate agent configuration and validation processes.\n\n**Core Responsibilities:**\n1. Illustrate correct agent setup\n2. Provide example responses\n3. Validate configuration best practices\n\n**Output Format:**\n- Clear, concise explanations\n- Demonstrate agent capabilities\n- Showcase configuration details\n```\n\n### Key Corrections\n\n1. **Identifier**: \n   - \u274c Old: `my_test_agent_v2.1`\n   - \u2705 New: `my-test-agent-v21`\n   - Reason: Only lowercase, hyphens, numbers allowed\n\n2. **Description**:\n   - \u274c Old: \"helps with testing\"\n   - \u2705 New: Comprehensive description with:\n     - Triggering conditions\n     - Multiple examples\n     - Commentary explaining use cases\n\n### Validation Checks Passed\n- Identifier meets 3-50 character rule\n- Starts and ends with alphanumeric\n- No special characters\n- Description provides clear context\n- Examples show when to use the agent\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of the correction in more detail?",
