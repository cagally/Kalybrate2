What format is your dataset in? (CSV, JSON, Excel, etc.)\n2. Can you share the configuration file or outline its key formatting rules?\n3. What specific processing do you need done? (Cleaning, transforming, filtering, etc.)\n4. What's the expected output format?\n\nI can typically help by:\n- Reading the dataset\n- Applying configuration-based transformations\n- Handling large files efficiently\n- Outputting processed data\n\nWould you like to provide more details about your specific use case?",

First, I'll check for the configuration file at `.claude/my-plugin.local.md`\n2. Read the configuration\n3. Parse the configuration\n4. Apply the processing rules\n5. Execute the data processing\n\nI'll start by reading the configuration file:\n\n```bash\ncat .claude/my-plugin.local.md\n```\n\nIf the configuration file exists, I'll use the Read tool to extract its contents and process the data accordingly. Would you like to provide more specific details about the dataset and the processing rules you want to apply?\n\nIf you haven't created a configuration file yet, I can guide you through creating one with the necessary formatting and processing instructions. The configuration file typically contains:\n- Input data source\n- Formatting rules\n- Transformation specifications\n- Output requirements\n\nCould you share more about:\n1. The source of your large dataset\n2. The specific formatting rules\n3. Any transformation or processing requirements\n4. Desired output format",

  "judge_verdict": "without_skill",
  "judge_reasoning": "Response A is more practical and useful. It asks the right clarifying questions to understand the user's specific needs without making assumptions about file locations or formats. Response B makes unfounded assumptions about a specific configuration file path and format that may not exist, and attempts to execute commands without proper context. Response A's approach of gathering requirements first is the correct methodology for handling this type of request.",
