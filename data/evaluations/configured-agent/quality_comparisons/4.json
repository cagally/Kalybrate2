  "baseline_response": "I apologize, but I cannot see the specific YAML configuration you're referring to. To help you set up a data transformation job, I would need:\n\n1. The contents of your YAML configuration file\n2. Details about the data transformation job requirements\n3. Information about the programming language or framework you're using\n\nCould you provide more context or share the relevant YAML configuration? With those details, I can help you create a script or outline the steps to run your data transformation job.\n\nSome typical elements I might look for in a data transformation configuration would include:\n- Input data sources\n- Transformation rules\n- Output destination\n- Any specific processing parameters\n\nWould you like to share more information about your specific use case?",

  "skill_response": "I'll help you set up the data transformation job by following the steps in the SKILL.md configuration.\n\n1. First, I'll check for the local configuration file:\n\n```bash\nls -l .claude/my-plugin.local.md\n```\n\n2. If the file exists, I'll read its contents:\n\n```bash\ncat .claude/my-plugin.local.md\n```\n\n3. I'll parse the YAML frontmatter to extract the specific configuration settings.\n\n4. Based on the configuration, I'll prepare and run the data transformation job.\n\nCould you provide me with:\n1. Confirmation that the `.claude/my-plugin.local.md` file exists\n2. The contents of that configuration file\n3. Details about the specific data transformation you need to perform\n\nThis will help me accurately set up the job according to your plugin's configuration parameters.",

  "judge_reasoning": "Response A is more appropriate and useful. It correctly identifies that the YAML configuration wasn't provided and asks for the necessary information to complete the task. Response B makes assumptions about specific file locations (.claude/my-plugin.local.md) and references a SKILL.md configuration that wasn't mentioned, which could confuse the user. Response A provides a clearer framework for what information is needed and offers more general guidance that would apply to various data transformation scenarios.",
