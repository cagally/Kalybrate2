Could you provide:\n\n1. An example of your YAML frontmatter\n2. The processing steps you want to apply\n3. Any specific input data\n\nWith those details, I can help you design a workflow that reads the custom parameters and applies the appropriate processing logic. Would you like to share more context about your specific use case?",

  "judge_verdict": "without_skill",
  "judge_reasoning": "Response A is more direct and practical by asking for the essential information needed (YAML frontmatter, processing steps, input data) without making assumptions. Response B makes specific assumptions about file locations (.claude/my-plugin.local.md) and references a 'skill description' that wasn't provided, which could confuse the user. Response A provides a clearer path forward for actually solving the user's problem.",
