Could you provide more details about:\n\n1. What the skill or task is\n2. The context in which it will be performed\n3. Any specific criteria you want me to use for comparison\n\nWith those details, I can help you create prompts that effectively compare quality across different approaches or implementations.",

Without understanding its functionality, purpose, and expected behavior, I can't effectively generate meaningful comparison prompts or test its capabilities.\n\nWould you be willing to:\n1. Describe the skill's intended functionality\n2. Share an example of how it's meant to be used\n3. Explain its core purpose or problem it solves\n\nThe more context you can provide, the better I can help you explore and validate the skill.",

They both ask for similar clarifying details (functionality, context, purpose) and offer to help once more information is provided. Response B mentions 'command-name' specifically and uses slightly different phrasing, but both are equally appropriate, complete, and useful for this situation.",
