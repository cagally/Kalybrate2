The context in which it's used\n\nIf you provide those details, I can craft meaningful comparison prompts that assess the skill's quality, effectiveness, or performance.",

  "judge_reasoning": "Response A is more general and adaptable, asking for the essential information needed to create comparison prompts without making assumptions about file formats or specific documentation. Response B assumes there's a SKILL.md file that wasn't mentioned in the task, making it less accurate and potentially confusing. Response A's structured approach with numbered points is also clearer and more actionable.",
