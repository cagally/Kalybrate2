If you can give me more details about the skill or technology you're interested in comparing, I'll be happy to assist you in generating quality comparison prompts.\n\nTo help me provide the most useful response, could you tell me:\n1. What is the skill or technology?\n2. What aspects of it are you looking to compare?\n3. What are the specific comparison criteria you're interested in?",

Could you provide more details about the \"command-name\" skill, such as:\n\n1. What does this skill/command do?\n2. What is its primary purpose?\n3. Are there any specific inputs or parameters it uses?\n4. What kind of output or result does it produce?\n\nWithout understanding the skill's functionality, I can't generate meaningful comparison prompts. Once you share more context about the skill, I'll be happy to help you create appropriate comparison-related questions or scenarios.",

  "judge_reasoning": "Response A better addresses the task by acknowledging the specific mention of 'command-name' skill from the original prompt and asks more targeted, technical questions about functionality, purpose, inputs, and outputs. Response B is more generic and doesn't reference the specific context provided, making it less useful for understanding what appears to be a technical skill or command.",
