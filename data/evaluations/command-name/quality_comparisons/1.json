While both correctly identify the need for more information, Response B provides specific context about a SKILL.md file and template, offers structured guidance with numbered points for what information is needed, and demonstrates better understanding of the technical context. Response A is adequate but generic, while Response B shows more engagement with the specific situation and provides actionable next steps.",
