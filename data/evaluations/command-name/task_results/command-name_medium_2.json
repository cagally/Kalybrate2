Could you provide more context about the skill you'd like me to help you develop? Specifically, I'd be helpful to know:\n\n1. What is the purpose of the skill?\n2. What specific functionality should it have?\n3. What inputs does it expect?\n4. What outputs or actions should it produce?\n\nThe more details you can share, the better I can assist you in creating a well-defined skill with appropriate test cases and implementation.",
