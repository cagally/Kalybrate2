The specific implementation details\n3. The expected inputs and outputs\n4. Any constraints or special conditions\n\nCould you provide more context about the skill you want me to help test? What is the purpose of the `command-name` skill? Without knowing its specific functionality, it's impossible to generate appropriate test cases.\n\nIf you'd like, you can share:\n- What the skill is supposed to do\n- What inputs it expects\n- What outputs or results it should produce\n- Any specific requirements or edge cases to consider",
