What output or action it performs\n4. Any constraints or special requirements\n\nCould you provide more details about the \"command-name\" skill? Without concrete information about its functionality, I can't generate appropriate test cases or verify its implementation.\n\nIf you'd like, I can help you:\n- Draft a detailed skill description\n- Create a sample implementation\n- Develop test cases\n- Outline the skill's expected behavior\n\nWhat specific functionality were you thinking of for this skill?",
