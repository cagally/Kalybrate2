  "baseline_response": "Here's a comprehensive approach to setting up automated reminders for code review checklists:\n\n1. GitHub/GitLab Actions Workflow:\n```yaml\nname: Code Review Checklist Reminder\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    branches:\n      - main\n      - develop\n\njobs:\n  checklist-reminder:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Check PR Template\n        uses: actions/github-script@v6\n        with:\n          script: |\n            const prBody = context.payload.pull_request.body;\n            const checklistItems = [\n              '- [ ] Performance considerations checked',\n              '- [ ] Security vulnerabilities reviewed',\n              '- [ ] Unit tests added/updated',\n              '- [ ] Documentation updated',\n              '- [ ] Error handling verified',\n              '- [ ] Logging implemented',\n              '- [ ] Code complexity analyzed'\n            ];\n\n            const missingItems = checklistItems.filter(item => \n              !prBody.includes(item.replace('- [ ]', '').trim())\n            );\n\n            if (missingItems.length > 0) {\n              core.setFailed('Missing checklist items: \\n' + missingItems.join('\\n'));\n            }\n\n      - name: Comment with Reminder\n        if: failure()\n        uses: actions/github-script@v6\n        with:\n          github-token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}\n          script: |\n            github.rest.issues.createComment({\n              issue_number: context.issue.number,\n              owner: context.repo.owner,\n              repo: context.repo.repo,\n              body: `\ud83d\udea8 Code Review Checklist Reminder \ud83d\udea8\n              \nPlease ensure the following checklist items are addressed:\n- Performance considerations\n- Security vulnerability review\n- Unit test coverage\n- Documentation updates\n- Error handling\n- Logging implementation\n- Code complexity analysis\n\nDetailed checklist:\n\\`\\`\\`\n- [ ] Performance considerations checked\n- [ ] Security vulnerabilities reviewed\n- [ ] Unit tests added/updated\n- [ ] Documentation updated\n- [ ] Error handling verified\n- [ ] Logging implemented\n- [ ] Code complexity analyzed\n\\`\\`\\`\n`\n            })\n```\n\n2. VS Code Extension (optional):\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"code-review-checklist\",\n  \"contributes\": {\n    \"commands\": [\n      {\n        \"command\": \"codeReview.showChecklist\",\n        \"title\": \"Show Code Review Checklist\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"configuration\": {\n      \"title\": \"Code Review Checklist\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"codeReview.checklistItems\": {\n          \"type\": \"array\",\n          \"default\": [\n            \"Performance\",\n            \"Security\",\n            \"Testing\",\n            \"Documentation\",\n            \"Error Handling\",\n            \"Logging\",\n            \"Code Complexity\"\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. Pre-Commit Hook Script (bash):\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nCHECKLIST_FILE=\".code_review_checklist\"\n\n# Check if checklist is complete\nif [ ! -f \"$CHECKLIST_FILE\" ]; then\n  echo \"Code review checklist not completed!\"\n  echo \"Please fill out the checklist before committing:\"\n  cat << EOF\nCode Review Checklist:\n[ ] Performance considerations\n[ ] Security review\n[ ] Unit tests\n[ ] Documentation\n[ ] Error handling\n[ ] Logging\n[ ] Code complexity\nEOF\n  exit 1\nfi\n```\n\n4. Slack/Teams Notification Integration:\n```python\ndef send_code_review_reminder(pr_details):\n    reminder_message = f\"\"\"\n    \ud83d\udd0d Code Review Checklist for PR: {pr_details['title']}\n    \n    Checklist Items:\n    \u2705 Performance Analysis\n    \u2705 Security Vulnerability Check\n    \u2705 Unit Test Coverage\n    \u2705 Documentation Updates\n    \u2705 Error Handling Review\n    \u2705 Logging Implementation\n    \u2705 Code Complexity Evaluation\n    \n    Review Link: {pr_details['link']}\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    slack_client.chat_postMessage(\n        channel='#code-reviews',\n        text=reminder_message\n    )\n```\n\nRecommended Implementation Strategy:\n1. GitHub Action for PR checklist validation\n2. VS Code extension for local development guidance\n3. Pre-commit hook to enforce checklist completion\n4. Slack/Teams integration for team-wide visibility\n\nAdditional Best Practices:\n- Customize checklist based on your team's specific requirements\n- Regularly review and update checklist items\n- Provide clear guidelines for each checklist item\n- Make checklist completion a collaborative, learning process\n\nThis multi-layered approach provides automated reminders, enforces best practices, and promotes code quality across your development workflow.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the code review automation?",

  "skill_response": "I'll help you create a Hookify rule that triggers when you're working with production-related files or code, reminding you of important code review checklist items. I'll create a rule in the `.claude/hookify.production-code-review.local.md` file.\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: production-code-review\nenabled: true\nevent: file\nconditions:\n  - field: file_path\n    operator: regex_match\n    pattern: (src/.*\\.tsx?|src/.*\\.jsx?|.*\\.prod\\..*|.*production.*|main\\..*|index\\..*|app\\..*|core/.*)\n---\n\n\ud83d\udea8 **Production Code Review Checklist** \ud83d\udea8\n\nYou're editing a file that looks like production code. Before submitting, please verify:\n\n**Code Quality Checklist:**\n- [ ] Ran unit tests locally\n- [ ] Ran integration tests\n- [ ] Performed manual testing\n- [ ] Added/updated relevant tests\n- [ ] Code follows team's style guide\n- [ ] No debug/console.log statements\n\n**Security Checklist:**\n- [ ] No hardcoded credentials\n- [ ] Proper error handling\n- [ ] Input validation implemented\n- [ ] Sensitive data is protected\n- [ ] No unnecessary permissions\n\n**Performance Checklist:**\n- [ ] Reviewed for potential performance bottlenecks\n- [ ] Optimized database queries\n- [ ] Minimal unnecessary renders (React)\n- [ ] Efficient data fetching strategies\n\n**Documentation Checklist:**\n- [ ] Updated relevant documentation\n- [ ] Added/updated inline comments\n- [ ] README or API docs reflect changes\n\n**Deployment Considerations:**\n- [ ] Backwards compatibility checked\n- [ ] Migration scripts (if needed) prepared\n- [ ] Feature flags configured (if applicable)\n\n**Peer Review Preparation:**\n- [ ] Code is clean and readable\n- [ ] Complex logic is explained\n- [ ] Large changesets are broken into smaller PRs\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Reminder:** These are guidelines.

The message provides a comprehensive checklist to help ensure code quality, security, performance, and thorough review before merging or deploying.\n\nKey features of this rule:\n1. Matches production-related file paths\n2. Provides a detailed, multi-section checklist\n3. Covers code quality, security, performance, documentation, and deployment\n4. Serves as a helpful reminder without being overly prescriptive\n\nYou can customize the file path patterns and checklist items to match your specific project and team standards.\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of the rule or help you adapt it to your specific workflow?",

  "judge_verdict": "without_skill",
  "judge_reasoning": "Response A provides a complete, working solution using GitHub Actions that actually automates reminders through PR comments and workflow failures. Response B appears to reference a fictional 'Hookify' system and creates a local markdown file that wouldn't actually trigger automated reminders. While B has a more comprehensive checklist, A delivers functional automation that accomplishes the core task of setting up automated reminders.",
