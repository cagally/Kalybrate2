  "response": "I'll create a pull request review command with the specifications you mentioned. I'll use Python to save the command file in the specified output directory.\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Ensure the output directory exists\nos.makedirs(OUTPUT_DIR, exist_ok=True)\n\n# Full path for the command file\ncommand_path = os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, 'review-pr.md')\n\n# Command content with YAML frontmatter and detailed review instructions\ncommand_content = '''---\ndescription: Quick pull request code review\nmodel: haiku\nallowed-tools: Read, Bash(git:*)\nargument-hint: [pr-number]\n---\n\nPerform a quick review of pull request #$1:\n\n1. Fetch PR details: !`gh pr view $1`\n\n2. List changed files: !`gh pr diff $1 --name-only`\n\n3. Rapid code review checks:\n   - Basic syntax and style\n   - Obvious logical errors\n   - Potential security quick wins\n   - Code complexity red flags\n\n4. Summarize key findings:\n   - Highlight critical issues\n   - Suggest immediate improvements\n   - Recommend areas for deeper review\n\nProvide a concise report focusing on high-impact observations.\n'''\n\n# Write the command file\nwith open(command_path, 'w') as f:\n    f.write(command_content)\n\nprint(f\"Pull request review command created at {command_path}\")\n```\n\nThis command does the following:\n\n1. Uses the `haiku` model for fast processing\n2. Allows `Read` and `git` Bash operations\n3. Expects a PR number as an argument\n4. Uses GitHub CLI (`gh`) to fetch PR details and diff\n5. Performs a quick, lightweight code review\n6. Generates a concise summary of key findings\n\nThe command is designed for rapid initial review, focusing on quick insights rather than comprehensive analysis. It leverages the fast `haiku` model and limited tools to provide a swift overview of the pull request.\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of the command or make any modifications?",
