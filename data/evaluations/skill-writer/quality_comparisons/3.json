Project Folder: Include specific data analysis details related to that project (tools used, specific techniques, key insights)\n\n2. Personal Skills Folder: List broader data analysis skills and proficiencies that apply across multiple projects\n\nThis approach provides a comprehensive view of your capabilities.",

  "skill_response": "Let me help you decide by asking a few clarifying questions:\n\n1. Is this data analysis skill:\n   - Specific to a particular project (like financial analysis for a startup)\n   - Or a general-purpose data analysis tool you might use across different projects?\n\n2. Will other team members need to use this skill?\n   - If yes, project folder (.claude/skills/)\n   - If no, personal skills folder (~/.claude/skills/)\n\n3. Does the skill depend on:\n   - Project-specific libraries or configurations\n   - Personal settings or custom scripts\n\nThe general guidelines are:\n- Project Skills (.claude/skills/): Team-shared, project-specific, version-controlled\n- Personal Skills (~/.claude/skills/): Individual workflows, personal tools, experimental skills\n\nCould you provide more context about the data analysis skill's purpose and scope? This will help me recommend the best location.",

  "judge_reasoning": "Response B provides a more systematic decision-making framework with specific technical details about file paths and team collaboration considerations. It asks clarifying questions to help the user make an informed decision rather than just suggesting to put it in both places. Response B is more thorough and actionable, giving clear guidelines and criteria for the decision.",
