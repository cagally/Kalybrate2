  "judge_reasoning": "Response A provides a complete, well-structured design concept that fully addresses the task requirements. It delivers a comprehensive booking interface design with clear visual elements, community features, and creative inspiration. Response B starts with good technical detail but cuts off mid-sentence in the CSS section, leaving the design incomplete. While B shows promise with code examples and specific styling, A offers a more thorough and usable complete solution that better serves someone looking to implement a co-working space booking interface.",
