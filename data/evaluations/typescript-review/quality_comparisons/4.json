  "judge_reasoning": "Response B is more thorough and useful. While both correctly identify that no code was provided, Response B goes further by explicitly outlining what the reviewer will be looking for (type safety, React hook usage, performance, best practices, readability). This gives the user a clear preview of the review criteria and demonstrates the reviewer's expertise, making it more valuable and actionable.",
