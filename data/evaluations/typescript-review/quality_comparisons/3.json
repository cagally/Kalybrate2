While both correctly identify that no code was provided, Response A goes further by listing specific TypeScript best practices it would check for (PascalCase naming, descriptive names, proper type annotations, optional vs required properties, avoiding 'any' types). This gives the user concrete guidance on what constitutes good TypeScript interface design, making it more educational and valuable even without the actual code to review.",
