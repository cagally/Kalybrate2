Could you please paste the component you'd like me to review? \n\nWhen reviewing a React component, I typically look for:\n\n1. TypeScript Type Safety\n- Proper type annotations\n- Use of interfaces/types\n- Avoiding any type\n\n2. React Best Practices\n- Component structure\n- Prop and state management\n- Functional component design\n- Hooks usage\n- Memoization where appropriate\n\n3. Performance Considerations\n- Avoiding unnecessary re-renders\n- Efficient state updates\n- Proper dependency arrays in hooks\n\n4. Code Organization\n- Component size\n- Separation of concerns\n- Meaningful variable and function names\n- Consistent formatting\n\n5. Error Handling\n- Prop validation\n- Error boundaries\n- Graceful error management\n\n6. Accessibility \n- Semantic HTML\n- Proper ARIA attributes\n- Keyboard navigation support\n\nPlease share your component, and I'll provide a comprehensive review and recommendations for improvement.\n\nWould you like me to provide an example of a well-structured TypeScript React component to illustrate best practices while you prepare your code?",

  "judge_reasoning": "Response B is more thorough and useful. While both correctly identify that no code was provided, Response B goes significantly further by outlining a comprehensive framework for TypeScript React component review, covering 6 detailed categories including type safety, performance, accessibility, and error handling. It also offers to provide an example component, making it more helpful and actionable for the user. Response A is more concise but less informative.",
