  "baseline_response": "I apologize, but I cannot actually review a pull request or TypeScript code without seeing the specific code you're referring to. To help you effectively, could you:\n\n1. Share the relevant code snippets\n2. Specify any specific concerns you have\n3. Describe the context of the changes\n\nI can help you look for:\n- Type safety issues\n- Potential type assertions\n- Unnecessary type castings\n- Proper use of interfaces and types\n- Potential null/undefined handling\n- Typescript best practices\n\nWould you like to share more details about the changes?",

To provide a thorough review, I'll need you to:\n\n1. Share the specific TypeScript code diff or changes\n2. Provide context about the specific file or component being modified\n\nCould you paste the code changes or diff so I can analyze them for:\n- Type safety issues\n- Potential style violations\n- TypeScript best practices\n- Potential improvements in type definitions\n- React component patterns (if applicable)\n\nOnce you share the code, I'll use the typescript-review skill to conduct a comprehensive review.",

  "judge_reasoning": "Both responses correctly identify that no code was provided and cannot complete the actual review task. They both appropriately ask for the necessary information and outline what they can help with once code is shared. Response A is slightly more organized in its bullet points, while Response B mentions a 'typescript-review skill' which may not exist. However, the core quality and usefulness are essentially equivalent - both fail to complete the task for the same valid reason and provide similar guidance on next steps.",
