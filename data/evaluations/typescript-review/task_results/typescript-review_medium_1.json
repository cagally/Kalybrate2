  "response": "I'll help you review the TypeScript React authentication component. However, I noticed that you haven't actually shared the code yet. Could you please provide the specific code you'd like me to review? \n\nWhen reviewing TypeScript React components, I'll typically look for:\n\n1. Type safety and TypeScript best practices\n2. React component structure and patterns\n3. Prop and state typing\n4. Proper error handling\n5. Performance considerations\n6. Coding style and conventions\n7. Potential security issues in authentication logic\n\nTo give you a comprehensive review, I'll need to see the actual code. Could you paste the component code, and I'll provide a detailed analysis using the typescript-review skill?\n\nSome specific things I'll be checking for in an authentication component include:\n- Proper typing of props and state\n- Secure handling of authentication tokens\n- Separation of concerns\n- Error handling\n- Use of modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)\n- Potential security vulnerabilities\n\nWould you like to share the code for review?",
