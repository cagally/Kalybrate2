  "prompt": "I need a simple Clojure function that takes a list of numbers and returns their sum. Can you write and test it for me?",
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",
  "response": "I'll demonstrate a REPL-driven approach to writing this function. I'll show you the implementation and how to test it.\n\n```clojure\n(defn sum-numbers\n  \"Takes a list of numbers and returns their sum.\"\n  [numbers]\n  (reduce + numbers))\n```\n\nLet's break this down:\n- `defn` defines a new function named `sum-numbers`\n- The docstring describes what the function does\n- `[numbers]` is the parameter list (a single parameter expecting a list/vector of numbers)\n- `(reduce + numbers)` uses Clojure's `reduce` function to sum all numbers\n  - `+` is the function applied to each element\n  - `numbers` is the collection being reduced\n\nHere's how you would test this in a REPL:\n\n```clojure\n;; Test cases\n(sum-numbers [1 2 3 4 5])     ;; Should return 15\n(sum-numbers [])               ;; Should return 0\n(sum-numbers [-1 0 1])         ;; Should return 0\n```\n\nKey points about this implementation:\n- Works with empty lists (returns 0)\n- Works with positive and negative numbers\n- Uses functional programming principles\n- Concise and idiomatic Clojure\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of the implementation?",
