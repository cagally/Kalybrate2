  "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",
  "response": "I'll help you create a simple Clojure function to filter even numbers from a vector, following the REPL-driven development workflow I described.\n\nHere's a complete example:\n\n```clojure\n(defn even-numbers\n  \"Filters and returns only even numbers from a collection.\"\n  [numbers]\n  (filter even? numbers))\n\n;; Example usage and testing\n(def sample-vector [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10])\n\n;; REPL interaction to test the function\n(even-numbers sample-vector)\n;; Expected output: (2 4 6 8 10)\n```\n\nLet me break this down:\n\n1. `defn` creates a function named `even-numbers`\n2. The docstring describes what the function does\n3. `filter` is a core Clojure function that keeps elements matching a predicate\n4. `even?` is a built-in Clojure predicate that checks if a number is even\n5. The function works with vectors, lists, or any sequence\n\nYou can also write a more explicit version if you prefer:\n\n```clojure\n(defn even-numbers\n  \"Filters and returns only even numbers from a collection.\"\n  [numbers]\n  (filter (fn [x] (= (mod x 2) 0)) numbers))\n```\n\nThis version uses an anonymous function that explicitly checks if a number is divisible by 2.\n\nTo test in a REPL, you would:\n1. Evaluate the function definition\n2. Create a sample vector\n3. Call the function with the vector\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation?",
