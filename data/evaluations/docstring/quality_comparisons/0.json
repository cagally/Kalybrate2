It includes the mathematical formula using LaTeX notation, uses raw string formatting (r\"\"\"), follows Sphinx documentation style, and provides more detailed explanations of the reduction methods. While Response B has good practical examples with actual tensor values, Response A's adherence to PyTorch documentation standards, inclusion of mathematical notation, and more thorough technical documentation makes it superior for a PyTorch function.",
