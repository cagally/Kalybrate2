Defaults to True.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: Tensor after applying dropout, with same shape as input.\n\n    Example:\n        >>> input_tensor = torch.randn(3, 4)\n        >>> output_tensor = apply_dropout(input_tensor, p=0.3)\n    \"\"\"\n    return F.dropout(x, p=p, training=training)\n```\n\nThis docstring includes:\n- A brief description of what the function does\n- Explanation of dropout's purpose\n- Detailed parameter descriptions\n- Return value description\n- A simple usage example",
