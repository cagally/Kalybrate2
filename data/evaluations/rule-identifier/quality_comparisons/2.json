  "baseline_response": "Here are some effective approaches for providing contextual warnings and suggestions:\n\n1. Real-time inline validation\n- Show immediate feedback as users interact\n- Use clear, concise language\n- Provide specific guidance on how to correct issues\n- Use color coding (red for errors, yellow for warnings)\n\n2. Contextual tooltips\n- Display helpful information on hover/focus\n- Explain complex actions or fields\n- Offer optional additional details\n- Keep tooltips concise and relevant\n\n3. Progressive disclosure\n- Reveal complexity gradually\n- Start with simple default options\n- Offer advanced settings/details on demand\n- Use expandable sections or step-by-step guides\n\n4. Smart defaults and suggestions\n- Pre-populate fields with intelligent recommendations\n- Suggest likely choices based on user history/context\n- Make optional suggestions non-intrusive\n- Allow easy customization\n\n5. Conversational/natural language guidance\n- Frame warnings as helpful suggestions\n- Use friendly, human-like tone\n- Explain potential consequences clearly\n- Offer clear next steps\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches or discuss implementation strategies?",

  "skill_response": "Based on the context of the rule-identifier skill I see, one of the best approaches to providing contextual warnings and suggestions is to use trigger-based rule systems. Here's a comprehensive strategy:\n\n1. Rule-Based Detection\n- Use regex patterns to detect specific actions, inputs, or contexts\n- Define clear events/triggers (bash, file, prompt, etc.)\n- Create targeted messages for different scenarios\n\n2. Key Components\n- Specific pattern matching\n- Contextual message/guidance\n- Potential action recommendations\n\nExample Rule Structure:\n```markdown\n---\nname: security-warning\nenabled: true\nevent: bash\npattern: (?i)(rm\\s+-rf\\s+/|sudo\\s+rm)\n---\n\u26a0\ufe0f CRITICAL SYSTEM WARNING:\n- Detected potentially destructive command\n- This operation could cause irreversible system damage\n- Confirm you intend to execute this exact command\n- Recommended: Use more precise deletion targets\n```\n\n3. Best Practices\n- Be precise in pattern matching\n- Provide clear, actionable guidance\n- Use markdown for readability\n- Include potential risks and alternatives\n- Offer constructive recommendations\n\n4. Implementation Considerations\n- Lightweight and non-intrusive\n- Configurable/toggleable\n- Support multiple event types\n- Graceful, informative messaging\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these recommendations for contextual user guidance?",

  "judge_reasoning": "Response A provides a comprehensive, general framework for contextual warnings and suggestions that applies broadly across different systems and interfaces. It covers multiple proven UX patterns like real-time validation, tooltips, progressive disclosure, and smart defaults. Response B focuses narrowly on a specific rule-based system with technical implementation details that may not be relevant to many users. Response A is more complete, universally applicable, and offers practical guidance that would be useful regardless of the specific technology stack.",
