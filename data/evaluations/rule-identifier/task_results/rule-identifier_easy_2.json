  "response": "To help you understand when the rule-identifier skill would activate, I'll explain the key components:\n\n1. `event`: This specifies when the skill can be triggered. The options are:\n   - `bash`: Activates during bash command interactions\n   - `file`: Activates during file-related operations\n   - `stop`: Activates at a stopping point\n   - `prompt`: Activates during prompt interactions\n   - `all`: Activates in all scenarios\n\n2. `pattern`: This is a regex (regular expression) pattern that must match for the skill to trigger.\n\nHowever, in the example you've shared, the specific details are placeholders:\n- `regex-pattern-here` needs to be replaced with an actual regex pattern\n- The message is currently generic\n\nTo give a concrete example, here's how it might look in practice:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: rule-identifier\nenabled: true\nevent: file\npattern: .*\\.py$\n---\n\nWarning: Python file detected. Ensure proper coding standards are followed.\n```\n\nIn this example, the skill would:\n- Activate during file-related events\n- Trigger when a filename ends with `.py`\n- Display a warning message about Python coding standards\n\nWould you like me to help you define a specific rule-identifier with a precise use case?",
