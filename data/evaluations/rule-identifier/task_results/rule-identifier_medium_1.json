  "response": "I'll help you configure a rule-identifier skill with a regex pattern. Here's an example of how you might set up such a rule:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: rule-identifier\nenabled: true\nevent: prompt\npattern: (\\bdelete\\b|\\bremove\\b|\\bdestroy\\b).*\\b(database|system|file|directory)\\b\n---\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f SECURITY ALERT: Potentially destructive command detected! \n- Command contains keywords that may indicate a risky operation\n- Please confirm intent and ensure you have proper authorization\n- Double-check the specific action you're about to take\n```\n\nLet me break down the components:\n\n1. `name`: A unique identifier for the rule\n\n2. `enabled`: Set to `true` to activate the rule\n\n3. `event`: \n   - `prompt`: Triggers on user input\n   - You could also use `bash` for shell commands, `file` for file operations, etc.\n\n4. `pattern`: A regex that matches potentially risky commands\n   - `(\\bdelete\\b|\\bremove\\b|\\bdestroy\\b)` matches words like delete, remove, destroy\n   - `.*\\b(database|system|file|directory)\\b` looks for potential target types\n\nThis rule would catch commands like:\n- \"delete database\"\n- \"remove system files\"\n- \"destroy directory\"\n\nThe message provides a warning and prompts for careful consideration before proceeding.\n\nWould you like me to help you customize this pattern for your specific use case?",
